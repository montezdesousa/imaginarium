# Imaginarium

Imaginarium is a reverse image search engine. Wut? It is basically a cheap version of Google Lens.

The engine receives an image hosted on the web and searches similar images on the archive database.

Well, actually it's only on a subset, 43k images were loaded in the model.

To do this it uses a pre-trained neural network and applies K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to find the most similar images.

This work has been submitted for the annual contest of Arquivo.pt, the Portuguese web archive, which awards original works based on the archive.

The project was awarded an honorable mention by [Aveiro Media Competence Center](https://a-mcc.eu/pt).
